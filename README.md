## Environment Setup

1. Install Node.js (recommended version >= 14)
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers dotenv
# Initialize the project
npm init -y
```

## Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file and add the following content:

```env
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=Your Infura Project ID
PRIVATE_KEY=Your Private Key (without 0x prefix)
```

## Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npx hardhat test
# Run a specific test file
npx hardhat test test/OptimizedToken.test.js
```

## Deploy Contracts

### Local Test Network Deployment

1. Start the local node: `npx hardhat node`
2. Deploy the contract in a new terminal: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`

### Goerli Test Network Deployment

Ensure that the `.env` file is correctly configured, then execute:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## Interact with the Contract

### Using Hardhat Console

```bash
# Connect to local network
npx hardhat console --network localhost
# Connect to Goerli test network
npx hardhat console --network goerli
```

Within the console, you can perform the following operations:

```js
// Get the contract factory
const Token = await ethers.getContractFactory('OptimizedToken')
// Connect to the deployed contract
const token = await Token.attach('Address of the deployed contract')
// Call contract methods
await token.name()
await token.symbol()
```

## Common Issue Resolution

### Compilation Errors

- Check if the Solidity version is correct
- Ensure all dependent contracts are in the contracts directory
- Verify the import paths are correct

### Test Failures

- Confirm that all dependencies are correctly installed
- Check if the parameters in the test cases are reasonable
- View test coverage reports

### Deployment Failures

- Verify network configuration is correct
- Ensure the account has enough test tokens
- Check gas price settings

## Security Tips

- Do not commit the `.env` file containing real private keys to version control
- Conduct thorough testing before deploying to the mainnet
- Regularly perform security audits

## Code Optimization Suggestions

1. Gas Optimization

   - Use uint256 instead of smaller integer types
   - Avoid reading and writing state variables in loops
   - Use memory and storage appropriately

2. Security Optimization

   - Implement an emergency pause mechanism
   - Add role-based access control
   - Increase event monitoring mechanisms
